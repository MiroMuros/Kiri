   - Side view (recommended)
   - Detail shots of collars, cuffs, etc. (optional)

3. Upload your photos using the interface:
   - Click on each tab (Front View, Back View, Side View, Details)
   - Use the "Upload" button to select and upload your photos
   - Verify that each photo appears in the preview area

4. Click "Next: Input Measurements" to proceed

### Step 2: Input Measurements

1. Enter your custom measurements:
   - Bust/Chest: Measure around the fullest part of your bust/chest

## Tips for Best Results

- Use high-quality, well-lit photos with good contrast between the garment and background
- Take photos straight-on, not at an angle
- Include a ruler or measuring tape in at least one photo for scale reference
- For complex garments, take additional detail photos of specific features
- Measure carefully and double-check your measurements before generating patterns
- For first-time users, start with simple garments like t-shirts or skirts

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Photos not uploading**
   - Ensure your photos are in JPG, PNG, or GIF format

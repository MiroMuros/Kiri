### Data Flow

1. User uploads photos and inputs measurements through the UI
2. Image processing module analyzes photos to detect garment type and features
3. Image processing module reconstructs a 3D model of the garment
4. Pattern generation module converts the 3D model into 2D pattern pieces
5. Pattern generation module adds construction details and adjusts for size
6. Pattern generation module exports patterns in various formats
7. UI presents the results to the user for download

- **PatternSegmenter**: Divides 3D model into logical pattern pieces
- **PatternFlattener**: Converts 3D surfaces to 2D patterns with minimal distortion

#### 2. Pattern Annotation
- **PatternAnnotator**: Adds seam allowances, grain lines, and other markings
- **DartPlacer**: Places darts and pleats for proper fit

#### 3. Size Adjustment
- **PatternSizer**: Scales patterns based on custom measurements
- **StandardSizer**: Applies standard sizing rules

#### 4. Pattern Export
- **PatternExporter**: Generates output files in various formats (PDF, SVG, DXF)

### User Interface Module

The user interface module consists of the following components:

#### 1. Web Application
- **Flask Application**: Provides backend API endpoints
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Provides frontend user interface

#### 2. API Endpoints
- **/api/upload**: Handles file uploads for garment photos
- **/api/process**: Processes uploaded images and generates 3D model
- **/api/generate-pattern**: Generates pattern based on 3D model and measurements
- **/api/files**: Serves generated files

## Technology Stack

### Backend
- **Python 3.10+**: Core programming language
- **Flask**: Web framework for API endpoints
- **OpenCV**: Computer vision library for image processing
- **NumPy**: Numerical computing library
- **TensorFlow** (placeholder): Machine learning framework for garment analysis

### Frontend
- **HTML5/CSS3**: Structure and styling
- **JavaScript**: Client-side functionality
- **Bootstrap 5**: UI framework for responsive design

### Testing
- **unittest**: Python testing framework

## Implementation Details

### Image Processing Implementation

The image processing module uses computer vision techniques to analyze clothing photos:

1. **Image Validation**: Checks image resolution, aspect ratio, and quality
2. **Preprocessing**: Resizes images, normalizes colors, and removes backgrounds
3. **Garment Classification**: Uses a classification model to identify garment type
4. **Feature Detection**: Detects key points like shoulders, waist, hem, etc.
5. **Measurement Estimation**: Calculates dimensions based on detected features
6. **3D Reconstruction**: Creates a 3D mesh model based on detected features

In a production environment, this would use trained machine learning models. The current implementation includes placeholder code that demonstrates the architecture and flow.

### Pattern Generation Implementation

The pattern generation module converts 3D models to 2D patterns:

1. **Model Segmentation**: Divides the 3D model into logical pattern pieces
2. **Surface Flattening**: Projects 3D surfaces onto 2D planes with minimal distortion
3. **Dart Placement**: Adds darts and pleats for proper fit
4. **Seam Allowance**: Adds customizable seam allowances to pattern pieces
5. **Construction Markings**: Adds grain lines, notches, and other markings
6. **Size Adjustment**: Scales patterns based on measurements
7. **Export**: Generates files in various formats

The implementation includes algorithms for handling different garment types and construction techniques.

### User Interface Implementation

The user interface provides a step-by-step workflow:

1. **Photo Upload**: Multi-tab interface for uploading different views
2. **Measurement Input**: Forms for custom measurements or standard sizes
3. **Pattern Preview**: Visualization of 3D model and pattern pieces
4. **Export Options**: Selection of output formats and additional resources

The UI is responsive and works on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Deployment

### Development Environment

To set up a development environment:

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the application: `python main.py`
4. Access the application at `http://localhost:5000`

### Production Deployment

For production deployment, we recommend:

1. Using a WSGI server like Gunicorn
2. Setting up a reverse proxy with Nginx
3. Configuring proper security headers
4. Using environment variables for configuration

Example production setup:

```bash
# Install Gunicorn
pip install gunicorn

# Run with Gunicorn
gunicorn -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:8000 "main:flask_app"
```

Nginx configuration:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name your-domain.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    }
}
```

## Testing

The application includes both unit tests and integration tests:

### Unit Tests

Unit tests verify the functionality of individual components:

- Image processing components (validation, preprocessing, classification)
- Pattern generation components (segmentation, flattening, annotation, sizing)

Run unit tests with:

```bash
python -m unittest tests/unit_tests.py
```

### Integration Tests

Integration tests verify the connections between components:

- UI to image processing workflow
- Image processing to pattern generation workflow
- End-to-end application testing

Run integration tests with:

```bash
python -m unittest tests/integration_tests.py
```

### Test Automation

A test runner script is provided to automate the testing process:

```bash
./run_tests.sh
```

## Future Enhancements

Potential areas for future development:

1. **Improved Computer Vision**: Train more accurate models for garment analysis
2. **Advanced 3D Reconstruction**: Implement more sophisticated 3D modeling techniques
3. **Fabric Simulation**: Add fabric property simulation for more accurate patterns
4. **Pattern Library**: Create a library of base patterns for different garment types
5. **User Accounts**: Add user accounts for saving and sharing patterns
6. **Mobile App**: Develop a dedicated mobile application

## Troubleshooting

Common development issues:

1. **Missing Dependencies**: Ensure all required packages are installed
2. **Port Conflicts**: Check if port 5000 is already in use
3. **File Permissions**: Ensure upload and output directories are writable

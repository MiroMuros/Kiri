3. **Seam Allowance Calculation**: Adding appropriate seam allowances based on garment type
   - Potential solution: Configurable seam allowance rules by edge type

### Measurement Challenges
1. **Scale Reference**: Determining actual size without physical reference points
   - Potential solution: Known reference object in photo or user-provided key measurements

2. **Fabric Distortion**: Accounting for stretch and drape in measurements
   - Potential solution: Fabric property input and physics-based simulation

## Implementation Approach
Based on the analysis, a hybrid approach combining deep learning for image analysis, parametric modeling for 3D reconstruction, and rule-based algorithms for pattern generation appears most feasible. The application will be developed as a web-based solution with a Python backend for image processing and pattern generation, and a JavaScript frontend for user interface and visualization.

## Next Steps
